      <p>This specification defines an “IME API” that provides Web applications
      with scripted access to an IME (<a href="#IME">input-method editor</a>)
      associated with a hosting user agent. This IME API includes:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>An <a>InputMethodContext</a> interface, which provides methods to
        retrieve detailed data from an in-progress IME
        <a href="#ime-composition">composition</a>,
        and to update that data.</li>
       <li>A <a>Composition</a> dictionary, which represents read-only attributes
        about the current
        <a href="#ime-composition">composition</a>,
        such as the actual text being input, its length, and its target
        <a href="#clause">clause</a>.
        <p class="issue">need to define what a <i>clause</i> is</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This API is designed to be used in conjunction with DOM events and
      elements on the Web platform, notably: composition events and the
      <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/2dcontext/">Canvas 2D Context API</a>
      [[CANVAS-2D]].</p>

        This document is a proposal that is being made available for public
        review in order to solicit feedback, particularly from
        implementors, with a goal of potential cross-browser implementation
        and standardization.
      </p>

    <section class='informative' id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Even though existing Web-platform APIs allow developers to implement very
      complicated Web applications, such as visual chat applications, using
      technologies such as SVG or the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element and API,
      developers have difficulties when implementing Web applications that
      control <a href="#IME">input-method editors</a>. To provide the
      ability for hosting user agents to expose Web applications to the
      <a href="#ime-composition">composition text</a>
      being composed in an associated IME,
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/">the DOM Level 3 Events specification</a>
      [[DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]]
      introduces <i>composition events</i>. Using composition events, Web
      applications can retrieve
      <a href="#ime-composition">composition text</a>
      from an IME.</p>

      <p>However, Web applications can still run into difficulties when
      they manipulate IMEs on non-editable elements such as the
      <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element; those difficulties include the fact
      that a Web application cannot do the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>indicate to the user whether the Web application renders
        composition text by itself, or needs to ask user agents to render it</li>
        <li>determine the place where user agents render composition text</li>
        <li>detect whether the user agent renders
        <a href="#candidate-window">candidate windows</a>
        by themselves</li>
        <li>determine the place where user agents render
        <a href="#candidate-window">candidate windows</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>To solve these IME-related problems, this specification introduces
      an IME API that allows Web applications to read and write composition
      data made available by user agents. Moreover, this specification introduces
      interfaces for
      <a href="#ime-composition">compositions</a>,
      so Web applications can read detailed composition
      data and update it. A <a>Composition</a> object provides a reference
      to an ongoing IME
      <a href="#ime-composition">composition</a>,
      so Web applications can retrieve the composition text and attributes.</p>

      <p>The use of those APIs allows Web applications the ability to
        give a hint where to set the
      position of a <a href="#composition-window">composition window</a>
      and to retrieve the text and attributes of the ongoing
      <a href="#ime-composition">composition</a>.</p>

      <p>Consider the following examples. The first example shows the
      source for a Web application that renders composition text by itself
      and uses the
      <a href="#candidate-window">candidate window</a>
      provided by an IME.</p>

      <h1>Background: What’s an Input Method Editor?</h1>
      <p>An <dfn id="IME">IME</dfn> (input-method editor) is an application
      that allows a standard keyboard (such as a US-101 keyboard) to be used to
      type characters and symbols that are not directly represented on the
      keyboard itself. In China, Japan, and Korea, IMEs are used ubiquitously to
      enable standard keyboards to be employed to type the very large number
      of characters required for writing in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.</p>
      <p>A <dfn id="system-ime">system IME</dfn> is an IME already installed on a user's system.
      <p>An IME consists of two modules; a <a href="#composer">composer</a>
      and a <a href="#converter">converter</a>.</p>

      <p>A <dfn id="composer">composer</dfn> is a context-free parser that
      composes non-ASCII characters (including phonetic characters) from
      keystrokes.</p>
      <p>A <dfn id="converter">converter</dfn> is a context-sensitive parser that looks up a
      dictionary to convert phonetic characters to a set of ideographic
      characters.</p>
      <p>An <dfn id="ime-clause">IME clause</dfn> is a grammatical word produced in an IME.</p>
      <p>An <dfn id="ime-selected-clause">IME selected clause</dfn> is an <a href="ime-clause">IME clause</a> being composed by an IME.</p>
      <p>An <dfn id="ime-composition">IME composition</dfn>
      is an instance of text produced in an IME. For IMEs that can produce multiple words, an IME composition consists of multiple IME clauses. For IMEs that produce only one word, an IME composition is equal to an IME clause.</p>

      <p>When an IME receives keystrokes, it sends the keystrokes to a
      composer and receives phonetic characters matching to the keystrokes. When
      an IME receives phonetic characters from a composer, it sends the phonetic
      characters to a converter and receives the list of ideographic characters
      matching to the phonetic characters. The following figure shows the
      basic structure of an IME.</p>

        <h1>Composer</h1>
        <p>A composer consists of two types of composers: a
        <a href="#phonetic-composer">phonetic composer</a>
        and a
        <a href="#radical-composer">radical composer</a>.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="phonetic-composer">phonetic composer</dfn> composes a phonetic
        character from its ASCII representation.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="radical-composer">radical composer</dfn> composes a
        phonetic character from <a href="#phonetic-radical">phonetic radicals</a>.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="phonetic-radical">phonetic radical</dfn> is a character component of a Latin character, a Chinese character, or a Korean character. A Latin character consists of an ASCII character and accent marks, e.g. a character '&aacute;' consists of an ASCII character 'a' and an accent mark '&acute;'. A Chinese character consists of Chinese character components that refer to its semantic origins, e.g. a Chinese character '&#x7565;' consists of two components '&#x7530;' and '&#x5404;'. A Korean character consists of Korean character components that represent consonants or vowels, e.g. a Korean character '&#xac00;' consists of a consonant '&#x3131;' and a vowel '&#x314f;'.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="composition-window">composition window</dfn> is a window that shows ASCII characters being composed by <a href="#phonetic-composer">phonetic composers</a> or <a href="#phonetic-radical">phonetic radicals</a> being composed by <a href="#radical-composer">radical composers</a>.</p>

        <p>An IME usually shows the text
        being composed by a composer with its own style to distinguish it from the
        existing text. Even though most of composers output phonetic characters,
        some composers (such as Bopomofo composers) output a placeholder character
        instead of phonetic characters while composing text.</p>

          <h3>Phonetic composer</h3>
          <p>Phonetic composers are not only used for typing Simplified
          Chinese and Japanese, but also used for typing non-ASCII characters (such
          as mathematical symbols, Yi, Amharic, etc.) with a US-101 keyboard. Each of
          these languages has a mapping table from its character to a sequence of
          ASCII characters representing its pronunciation: e.g.,
          &lsquo;&#x304B;&rsquo; to &lsquo;ka&rsquo; in Japanese, and;
          &lsquo;&#x5361;&rsquo; to &lsquo;ka&rsquo; in Simplified Chinese. This
          mapping table is called as Romaji for Japanese and Pinyin for Simplified
          Chinese, respectively. A phonetic composer uses these mapping tables to
          compose a phonetic character from a sequence of ASCII characters produced
          by a US keyboard.</p>
          <p>A phonetic composer for Simplified Chinese outputs the input

          <h3>Radical composer</h3>
          <p>Radical composers are mainly used for typing Traditional
          Chinese and Korean with phonetic keyboards. Each phonetic keyboard of these
          languages can produce phonetic radicals: e.g., typing &lsquo;r&rsquo;
          produces &lsquo;&#x3131;&rsquo; on a Korean keyboard; typing
          &lsquo;o&rsquo; produces &lsquo;&#x4EBA;&rsquo; on a Traditional-Chinese
          (or Bopomofo) keyboard, etc. A radical composer composes a phonetic
          character from phonetic radicals given by these keyboards: e.g., typing
          '&#x3131;' (r) and '&#x314F;' (k) produces '&#xAC00;' on a Korean keyboard;
          typing &lsquo;&#x4EBA;&rsquo; (o), &lsquo;&#x5F13;&rsquo; (n), and
          &lsquo;&#x706B;&rsquo; (f) produces &lsquo;&#x4F60;&rsquo; on a
          Traditional-Chinese keyboard, etc.</p>
          <p>A radical composer for Korean outputs the phonetic radicals as
          its composition text.</p>

            <figcaption>Radical composer (Korean)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>A radical composer for Traditional Chinese outputs a
          placeholder character (U+3000) and shows the phonetic radicals being
          composed to its own window. This window is an example of a composition
          window.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Some platforms (such as Mac and Linux) use radical composers
          for typing accented characters used in European countries. For example,
          typing &lsquo; &#x308; &rsquo; (option+u) and &lsquo;a&rsquo; (a) produces
          &lsquo;&auml;&rsquo; on US keyboards of Mac.</p>

        <h2>Converter</h2>
        <p>A converter is a context-sensitive parser used for replacing
        the outputs of a composer to ideographic characters on Chinese, Japanese,
        and Korean.</p>
        <p class="note">Korean does not use ideographic characters so often.</p>

        <p>Because Chinese, Japanese, and Korean have many homonyms, each sequence of phonetic
        characters usually matches many ideographic characters: e.g., a Japanese
        phonetic character '&#x304B;' matches Japanese ideographic characters
        &lsquo;&#x5316;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&#x79D1;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&#x8AB2;&rsquo;,
        etc.; Pinyin characters &lsquo;ka&rsquo; matches Simplified-Chinese
        ideographic characters &lsquo;&#x5361;', &lsquo;&#x5580;&rsquo;,
        &lsquo;&#x54AF;&rsquo;, etc.; Bopomofo characters
        &lsquo;&#x4EBA;&#x5F13;&rsquo; matches Traditional-Chinese ideographic
        characters &lsquo;&#x4E5E;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&#x4EBF;&rsquo;,
        &lsquo;&#x4E87;&rsquo;, etc.</p>
        <p>A converter looks up a dictionary and shows a
        list of candidates of possible ideographic characters so a user can choose
        one. This list is known as a <dfn id="candidate-list">candidate list</dfn>.
        A candidate list is known as a <dfn id="candidate-window">candidate window</dfn>
        when it has its own window.</p>
        <p>Some Japanese IMEs show annotations in its <a href="#candidate-window">candidate window</a>
        for a character that is not so easy to distinguish from other characters
        (such as full-width alphabets, full-width Katakanas, and half-width
        Katakanas, etc.), as shown in the following figure.</p>

        <p>A converter often integrates an <dfn id="MRU">MRU</dfn> (Most-Recently Used) list.
        Even though there are many ideographic characters for each phonetic
        character (or phonetic radical), a user does not usually use all these
        ideographic characters. A converter uses an <a href="MRU">MRU list</a> to filter out
        ideographic characters not used so often from a
        <a href="#candidate-list">candidate list</a>.
        A converter
        sometimes integrates a grammar parser. A converter that integrates a
        grammar parser splits the given phonetic characters into grammatical
        clauses and converts only one clause at once. When a sequence of phonetic
        characters consists of n clauses and the i-th clause has m_i candidates,
        the total number of the candidates for the input characters become (m_1 *
        m_2 * &hellip; * m_n). To reduce the number of candidates owned by a
        converter, a converter usually processes one clause at once. This clause is
        called as a <dfn id="selected-clause">selected clause</dfn>.</p>

        <p>An IME usually renders a <a href="#selected-clause">selected clause</a> with
        a special style to distinguish it from other clauses, as shown in
        the following figure.</p>
        <figure id="fig-selected-clause">

          <figcaption>Selected clause (Japanese)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When a converter converts two or more clauses, it chooses
        candidates for the selected clause so it becomes grammatically consistent
        with the surrounding clauses: e.g., Japanese converters usually output
        &lsquo;&#x5371;&#x6A5F;&#x4E00;&#x9AEA;&rsquo; (not
        &lsquo;&#x5371;&#x6A5F;&#x4E00;&#x767A;&rsquo;) for Japanese phonetic
        characters &lsquo;&#x304D;&#x304D;&#x3044;&#x3063;&#x3071;&#x3064;&rsquo;
        because &lsquo;&#x5371;&#x6A5F;&#x4E00;&#x767A;&rsquo; is grammatically
        incorrect.</p>

      <h1>The getInputContext() method</h1>
      <p>For each element, a user agent can choose an IME for the element.
      To control the IME attached to an element, it is a good idea to add a
      method to the HTMLElement interface.</p>
      <p class="issue">If the
      <code>getInputContext()</code>
      method cannot be added to the HTMLElement
      interface, it should be moved to the <a>InputMethodContext</a> interface.</p>

      <dl title='partial interface HTMLElement' class='idl'>
        <dt>InputMethodContext getInputContext()</dt>
          <dd>Returns an InputMethodContext interface associated with this element. By
          default, a user agent returns an InputMethodContext interface representing
          the system IME. To change the behavior of the IME associated with an
          element, authors must first obtain an InputMethodContext interface by
          calling the getInputContext() method of the HTMLElement interface.
